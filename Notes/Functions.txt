Functions
=============
Most basic building block of Go programs
Allows functionality to be isolated, which makes programs easier to:
    Test, debug, extend, modify, read, write, document
Functions are simple: they take data as input and return data as output
    Input and output data is optional

Ex:
==========INPUT DATA================OUTPUT DATA TYPE====
func name (param1 type, param2 type) type {
    //body 
}

//The type at the end is the output data

Ex:
func sum (lhs, rhs int) int {
    return lhs + rhs
}
// Can have multiple parameter with the same data type
