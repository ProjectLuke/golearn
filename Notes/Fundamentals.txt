Packages
================================================================
    Packages are Go's way of organizing code
    Programs are written as one or more Packages
        Packages can be imported from the Go package registry
    Packages should be focused and perform a single thing
        Argument parsing
        Drawing graphics
        Handling HTTP requests

ex:
    import "name"

    import (
        "name"
        "namespace/packageName"
    )


Modules
===========================================================
Modules are a collection of Packages
Created by having a go.mod file in the root directory of your project
    Can be managed by the Go CLI 
Contains information about your project
    Dependencies, Go version, package info 
All Go projects have a go.mod file


ex:
moodule example.com/practice

go 1.27

require (
    github.com/luke/somelinkhere v1.4.2
    github.com/luke/somelinkhere v1.13.0
)

namespace is the 'github.com/luke'
packageName is 'somelinkehere'

It is customary to include the link in the namespace so people can easily find the code
